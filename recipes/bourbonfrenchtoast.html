    <p>
        Nothing cures a hangover faster than a hot stack of bourbon french toast. 
        Even if you aren't a bourbon drinker, this is not something to pass up. 
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Brioche sliced bread</li>
        <li>Whole milk</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Bourbon</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar</li>
        <li>Maple syrup</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set out the slice of brioche ona lined baking sheet over night to dry out. 
            For a quicker but not as good result, put the baking sheet in the oven on the lowest possible setting. 
            Check frequently to see if the bread is dry to touch and remove once done. Let the bread fully cool.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, add all eggs and whisk until fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add in the vanilla, bourbon, salt, and the cinnamon to the eggs. Whisk to incorporate.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat up a tablespoon of batter until it begin to boil.</li>
        <li>While waiting, two pieces of bread in the egg mixture until thoroughly coated. Remove and let the excess drip off into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Once the bubles subside in the butter, place each piece of bread into the skillet. Make sure to leave space between the two pieces.</li>
        <li>Cook each side for about 2-3 minutes or until cripsy golden brown, then remove it from the skillet and plate.</li>
        <li>Carefully clean the reamining butter out of the pan and add fresh butter. Repeat the steps starting at step 4 until all of the bread or batter is cooked.</li>
        <li>Plate accordingly. Top with powdered sugar, maple syrup, and butter as desired.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
