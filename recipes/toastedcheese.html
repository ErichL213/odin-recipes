        I know what you are thinking. What is a <strong>toasted cheese</strong>? 
        Don't I really mean a <strong>grilled cheese</strong>? 
        The answer is no, I don't mean a <em>grilled</em> cheese. 
        A toasted cheese is very similar to a grilled cheese, but a lot easier to prepare. 
        You don't need a pan or a stove to cook it. 
        All you need is a toaster, bread, cheese, butter, and a knife.
